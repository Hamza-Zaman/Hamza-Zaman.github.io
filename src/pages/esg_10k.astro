  <h1>ESG 10-K Extraction (SEC EDGAR)</h1>
  <p>
    This project focuses on reliably finding the latest 10-K filings and extracting ESG-relevant
    sections from SEC EDGAR with a reproducible method.
  </p>

  <h2>Latest Extraction Method (Accurate)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Query the SEC submissions endpoint for a company CIK (or map tickers to CIKs).
    </li>
    <li>
      Filter <strong>forms = 10-K</strong> and sort by the newest <strong>filingDate</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use the latest accession number to locate the primary document in the filing index.
    </li>
    <li>
      Parse the filing HTML, then extract ESG sections using headings and keyword anchors
      (e.g., “Sustainability,” “Climate,” “Human Capital,” “Governance”).
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Outcome</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Accurate identification of the most recent 10-K filing.</li>
    <li>Repeatable ESG section extraction with minimal manual review.</li>
  </ul>
